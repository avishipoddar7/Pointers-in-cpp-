 # C++ Pointer Playground ðŸš€

This repository contains a collection of C++ programs that explore the fundamental concepts of pointers, including pointer arithmetic, array traversal, and string manipulation. Each program is a small experiment designed to illustrate a specific aspect of how pointers work in C++.

## ðŸ§© Conceptual Diagram of a Pointer

Hereâ€™s a simple visualization of how a pointer works:  
The pointer (`ptr`) doesn't hold the value **42** directly. Instead, it holds the **memory address** (`0x7ffee_...`) where the value 42 is stored. To get the actual value, you "follow" the pointer to that address using the **dereference operator** (`*`).

## ðŸ’¡ Core Concepts: Pointers in C++

- **Pointer Declaration**:  
  Use the asterisk `*` to declare a pointer.  
  Example:  
  ```cpp
  int *ptr; // Pointer to int

## ðŸ§ª Code Experiments

This table breaks down the purpose and logic of each C++ file in this repository.

| File Name  | Purpose | Logic Behind the Code |
|------------|---------|-----------------------|
| **exp9a.cc** | Demonstrate Pointer Incrementation | This program shows that when you increment a pointer, its value (the memory address) increases by the size of the data type it points to. An `int` pointer jumps 4 bytes, a `double` pointer jumps 8 bytes, and so on. This is fundamental to understanding how pointers navigate memory blocks like arrays. |
| **exp9b.cc** | Calculate the Difference Between Pointers | This experiment demonstrates that you can subtract one pointer from another (if they point to elements of the same array). The result is not the difference in memory addresses but the number of elements that separate them. This is useful for calculating the size of an array segment. |
| **exp9c.cc** | Traverse an Array in Reverse | By initializing a pointer to the last element of an array and then repeatedly decrementing it (`ptr--`), we can iterate through the array from end to start. This showcases the flexibility of pointers for non-linear or reverse data access. |
| **exp9d.cc** | Print a String Using a Pointer | This program iterates through a character array (a C-style string) using a pointer. It starts at the first character and moves forward until it encounters the null terminator (`\0`), which marks the end of the string. This is a classic and efficient way to handle strings in C++. |
