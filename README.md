 # C++ Pointer Playground ðŸš€

This repository contains a collection of C++ programs that explore the fundamental concepts of pointers, including pointer arithmetic, array traversal, and string manipulation. Each program is a small experiment designed to illustrate a specific aspect of how pointers work in C++.

## ðŸ§© Conceptual Diagram of a Pointer

Hereâ€™s a simple visualization of how a pointer works:  
The pointer (`ptr`) doesn't hold the value **42** directly. Instead, it holds the **memory address** (`0x7ffee_...`) where the value 42 is stored. To get the actual value, you "follow" the pointer to that address using the **dereference operator** (`*`).

## ðŸ’¡ Core Concepts: Pointers in C++

- **Pointer Declaration**:  
  Use the asterisk `*` to declare a pointer.  
  Example:  
  ```cpp
